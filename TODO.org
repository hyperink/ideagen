GOAL: Train a LDA classifier to take some 'content' and return a
topic_id and a metric

1. Data Sources (JSON)
2. List of three-tuples
entries = [('key', 'content', heuristic-rank-metric), ... ]
3. Content List: Create LDA input
- List containing str(content) from each tuple
4. Content List used to train black box LDA
- Output is a trained LDA classifier model
5. Map each entry onto a new tuple entry + topic_id
6. Reduce list of new entries into list of tuples
[(topic_id, sum(heuristic-rank-metric)), ... ]
7. Sort this list based on heuristic-rank-metric



NOTE: heuristic-rank-metric is diggs, # up votes, etc.
